1. The product that the coding commandos are going to develop is a finance app
2. The names we considered were KnightWallet and KnightFund
3. We decided to go with the name KnightWallet because it relates to our target group and identifies the type of app we are going to develop.
4. Our target customers are going to be college students who want to save spend money effectively while in college, but our app can be used by anyone country wide that wants to learn how to budget.
5. The features we are going to potentially incorporate a budgeting tool that will allow students to learn how to budget effectively, how to save effectivly and manage any assets.

Overall, our vision for our product is to get college students to learn how to take control of their finances.
