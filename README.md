1. The product that the coding commandos are going to develop is a fitness app
2. The names we considered were IronKnight and KnightForce
3. We decided to go with the name IronKnight because it relates to our target group and identifies the type of app we are going to develop.
4. Our target customers are going to be college students who want to stay in shape on campus, but our app can be used by anyone country wide that wants to get in shape.
5. The features we are going to potentially incorporate fall under 3 main categories: Nutrition, Cardio, Lifting. Within these categories we can develop different plans based on the goals of our users.

Overall, our vision for our product is to get college students to live healthly lifestyles and learn how to stay fit while going through college.
